Press Left Ctrl to randomize a new map

Switch starting ship by dragging a resources/ships/<asset> onto the 'ship' field in the inspector of the player object in the scene

Enemies are retarded, pay them little mind other then practice targets

There are 4 types of ships that use different ways of moving around and firing etc

## Interceptor
This is a lightweight ship that is used to hunt slower ships or mess with larger ones.
It can not do smart targeting and will only be able to hit if you align one of its sides to the target.

Fires single but powerful shots that really puts a dent in your opponent's armor.

## Crasher
Fast and nimble. Has no cannons and thrives only on the scrap left by broken ships.
Clever use of sneak attacks and scrap management is key to this little monster.
The more scrap that it eats, the larger it becomes(to a certain degree).
Becomes an easier target when grown but also that much deadlier.
Crash into other ships to deal damage. The larger the more damage.
